An astronautical experience in 2D space.

Make sure you have pygame installed in your system.
If you don't, open your terminal and type `pip install pygame`

Once everything is set. Change your terminal directory to folder containing the main.py file.
To run the game, type `python main.py` or `python3 main.py`(in some cases)

You can press spacebar to adjust the speed of your rover and travel through the endless galaxies. May add a teeny amount of fun in a boring life!
